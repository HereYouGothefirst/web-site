                    Become the owner of Tesla Model 3 with just $5 or $1000. The bigger amount of your contribution the

                <p class="idea-text">Hi guys,<br/><br/>

                    We are HereYouGo team, and we have a dream to bring autonomous driving technology to real life,
                    because it will reduce the number of accidents on the roads and decrease time that you spend on the
                    roads. We started developing this idea with research at the heart of Silicon Valley one year
                    ago.<br/>
                    We have created our first prototype with Donkey.Car - small robotics car and now we are going to
                    build business model around real car with the best level of autonomy (self-driving technology)
                    available on the market today.<br/>
                    With this crowdfunding campaign we are going to test ownership model within several owners
                    (contributors to this campaign) to bring efficiency in transportation. Self-driving cars will be
                    expensive and at the same time an average car owner uses the car just 4% of all time, so our model
                    will bring more effectiveness to the roads.
                </p>

                <p class="idea-text">
                    We love you all,<br/><br/>

                    HereYouGo team (Konstantin, Jenny, Alex, Carlos).

                    Self-driving technology will make enormous impact on our life:
                    It will decrease the number of accidents on the roads. Nowadays, 94% of accidents is happened
                    because of the drivers' error.</p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    It will decrease the number of time that we spend on the roads: transportation system will require
                    fewer cars to serve the same transportation needs, therefore there are will be less traffic jams on
                    the roads and you won't need to spend up to half of hour to find a parking slot in busy city area.
                    Moreover, parking difficulties account for 30â€”60 percent of downtown traffic, so no needs for
                    parking, no roads' congestion.</p>
                <p class="idea-text">

                    Self-driving cars will be expensive, we are going to launch this model to accelerate mass deployment
                    of self-driving cars by providing the opportunity for people to contribute small amount in
                    self-driving infrastructure development!
