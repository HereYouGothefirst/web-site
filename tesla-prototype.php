                    application of blockchain technology to ride-sharing services
                    increase the efficiency of transport system due to new technologies in finance.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">When contributions will be raised and Telsa will be bought, we will organize the registration of the car ownership in the DMV for all contributors proportionally to contributions. Then we will organize an insurance for the car taking into account decentralized ownership. We will test a new role in the industry â€“ the role of administrator of the car. In our vision this role can be executed by current drivers. So, when the self-driving technology will be mass deployed, the drivers will not lose their jobs, they will take another role. The new role will be consisted of organizational activities related to a car like coordination of registration, technical services, profit payments to contributors in crypto currency and insurance.</p>
                <p class="idea-text">We consider the blockchain technology as the most effective platform for transactional business execution. We plan to demonstrate the capabilities of the blockchain technology with our business prototype. We will reveal the simplicity and efficiency of transactions for purchasing of a share of a car as well as for receiving the profit in crypto currency into the same crypto wallet from which the contribution was transferred.</p>

                <p class="idea-text">We chose for demonstration the Tesla car, because Tesla has the highest level of autonomous technology which available on the market at the moment. Thus, we will be able to bring our prototype closer to the real conditions of using self-driving cars.</p>

                        business mode it in real life with real users. It will be exciting!

                    <p class="heading-description">Our business model will go through three stages of development
                        related to autonomy level of cars available on the market:

                <p class="idea-text">
                    1. The first stage is connected with the 3rd level of car autonomy. The cutting edge technology is
                    realized in Tesla car today, therefore we decided to build our prototype based on it. Monetization
                    model on this stage is crowd-funding for the Tesla car through the blockchain platform with crypto
                    currencies. We are going to buy up to three Tesla cars to test our prototype in conditions which is
                    close to the reality. The minimum available contribution to crowd-funding on this stage is $1000.
                    Further this contribution will be converted into share of our company proportionally to the
                    contribution.
                </p>
                <p class="idea-text">
                    2. The second stage is connected with 4th level of car autonomy which will be available on the
                    market within a year. This technology will allow to mainly refuse from driver services and the
                    effectiveness of car utilization will rise significantly because of human factor decrease. This
                    improvement in effectiveness will lead to convergence of the economy and car owners will start to
                    get return on investments up to 30% yearly. We will launch the mass crowd-funding of autonomous
                    cars. The minimum available contribution to the car ownership on this stage will be $100. The
                    monetization model will be based on fixed monthly renting payments per the car from taxi providers
                    like Uber and Lyft. We will charge the percentage from this amount for our operation services and
                    will transfer the rest of the money to car owners proportionally to their contribution to the car
                    crowd-funding. The role of drivers will be changed from driver services to administrative and
                    coordination role for self-driving cars.
                <p class="idea-text">
                    3. The third stage is connected with 5th level of car autonomy which will be available within three
                    years. The technology will transform the transportation system significantly. Because of the huge
                    improvement in effectiveness, the traffic jams will disappear, people will be commuted several times
                    faster and it will be not much a difference where to live â€“ within the city or in the nearby town.
                    The working hours will start from the time, when the person sits in the car, so the efficiency of
                    the economy and people life with increase. This technology will get access to easy transportation
                    for seniors, children and disabled people. Ion this stage automobiles will be purchased on the same
                    principle of crowd-funding through the blockchain platform with crypto currencies. The minimum
                    available contribution will not be set, so, it can be any amount due to the fact that regulation
                    will be adapted for the crowd-funding. Cars will be operated without third-party providers due to
                    rise in intellectual capabilities of cars. The monetization model will be turned to commission
                    based. The car owners will get the price which users paid for the taxi service deducting our
                    commission. The taxi drivers will have to learn new skills to be qualified to hold the changed role
                    of administrator and financial coordinator of the cars.</div>
